> Functionality first; Efficiency next.

Smokehill is an simplistic package manager for Idris, I take many
short cuts and my design decisions are more for simplicity and initial
functionality.  I don't use Haskell much as my FP lang of choice is
Idris, my Haskell-Foo is not strong---What are Monads?

The engineering quality and design and this code is real bad and needs improvement.

If you don't like anything PRs are for the most part 'welcome'.

Questions? please ask.
