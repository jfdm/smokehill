# Smokehill

> Functionality first; Efficiency next.

Smokehill is an simplistic package utility for Idris. It helps me with the installation of the packages that I have authored or have used. This has evolved from an initial bash -> shelly -> bash script i have used over the years. I have decided to clean it up, slap some monads on, and release it to the world.

The engineering quality and design and this code is not my greatest and needs improvement. Haskell is not my primary FP language, Idris is, with that said my Haskell knowledge and ability is not as good as my Idris foo. So forgive the Haskell quality.

If you don't like anything PRs are for the most part 'welcome'.

Questions? please ask.

> Why not write this in Idris?

Fact: I like Idris and dependent types. 

This project is in Haskell rather than Idris is for two main reasons:

1. Haskell package eco-system is more developed and, when I search Idris' libraries the functionality that provides for system programming and interaction are just not there yet. It will be but for the time being some things are quicker to achieve using pre-built libraries than building them all myself...

2. I thought it would be good to learn Haskell for the Greater Good, and for the CV!
